The steps are ther same for every blueprint type.

1. Go into Edit Mode and add a new card/page.
2. Choose Dwains Dashboard Blueprint and click on Use This Blueprint.

## Updating Blueprints

When there is a new version of the blueprint released you can simply follow the same steps as improting a blueprint.
<br> The files will automatically change. After importing the new verison of the blueprint you need to apply it on the card/page where you are using the old version.
<br>Therefore you go into edit mode and edit the card/page. Wait a moment and the new version will be loaded. 
<br> Then submit changes and the new blueprint is used.
