 # I prefer darksky for weather:
 # use the weather component and not (only) the darksky sensor! Read here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/
 # Some people only have the DarkSky sensor and not the weather setup or visa versa.
 # Please check this!!!!!!
 # If you want darksky USE THIS: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/
 # AND USE THIS: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/darksky/
 # So make sure you got both installed! It's not the same!
